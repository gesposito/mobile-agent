# Benchmark report

Started 2026-10-10T09:13:23Z, finished 2026-10-10T09:40:03Z. Durations are milliseconds; percentiles are nearest-rank over the measured iterations, with warm-up iterations excluded. Fail % is the share of measured iterations in which no attempt succeeded, Flake % the share that succeeded only on a retry.

## Comparison

p50 / p95 in milliseconds per tool and target; — where a tool did not measure the subject.

| Target | Fixture | Screen | Subject | mobile-agent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| IPHONE-SE-UDID | expo | — | flow list-scroll | 27462.012 / 56568.564 |

## Hand-offs

Between series, before another tool drives a target and once the run is over, the tool that drove it lets go of it, the run waits until nothing that tool keeps for the target is left running, ending itself what the release did not reach, and an Android target gets back the input method the run found.

| Target | From | To | ms | What happened |

| IPHONE-SE-UDID | mobile-agent | end of the run | 2492.212 | stopped the daemon |
